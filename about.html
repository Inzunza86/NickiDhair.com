      <div class="biography">
        <p>My name is Nicki Green DeHaven. I was born in
Kansas City and currently live in Gardner. In 2001,
I started my journey in the hair industry. I
currently have a booth at The Hairem in Olathe.
Since 2001, I have been expanding my skills in
color application, hairstyles, nail techniques, and
many other skills. I have had opportunity to go to
hair shows and learn from the best in the business.
I have certifications in Redken Exchange,
Tressallure, extensions, Keratin treatments. I truly
love what I do and enjoy watching my clients smile
when they look into the mirror.
